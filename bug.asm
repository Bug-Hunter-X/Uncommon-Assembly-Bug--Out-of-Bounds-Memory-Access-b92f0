mov eax, [esi+ebx*4+0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as [esi + ebx*4 + 0x10].  The problem arises if the calculation results in an address outside the bounds of allocated memory or attempts to access memory that the program doesn't have permission to access. This can lead to a segmentation fault or access violation.
